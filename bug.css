The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on CSS values, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if the syntax is not correct or if the units are inconsistent.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` is fine, but `calc(100% - 10)` will produce an error because the unit is missing in 10. Another example is `calc(50% + 50%)`, which is valid but might not always behave as expected if you intended the sum to be 100% of a parent container and that parent container's dimension is not explicitly set.
